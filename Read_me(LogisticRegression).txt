Diabetes Prediction

Objective
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

Contents
This project is meant to explore, analyse, visualize and predict if a person have a chances to be diabetic by exploring the following columns:
    1. pregnant - how many times that person has been pregnant
    2. glucose - the level of glucose
    3. bp - Diastolic blood pressure
    4. skin - Triceps skin fold thickness
    5. insulin - 2-Hour serum insulin
    6. bmi - Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
    7. pedigree - DiabetesPedigreeFunction
    8. age - Age (years)
    9. label - target variable whether the person is diabetic or not

Machine Learning Steps Follwed to acheve the objective.

    1. Import necessary Libraries
    2. Read the csv dataser
    3. Check for the null values and the unwanted values in the dataset
         - We checked for the null values but there are no null and unwanted values present in the dataset.
    4. Train Test Split
    5. Perform Logistic Regression  on Train data 
         - We can perform logistic Regression on the system as the values to predict are binary in nature i.e., a person can either be                  diabetic or not.
    6. Prediction of Train data
         - We got the accuracy of  - 0.78 for Train data 
    7. Prediction of Test data </ul>
         - We got the Test accuracy of - 0.75, Hence the model is neither underfiting not over fitting.
